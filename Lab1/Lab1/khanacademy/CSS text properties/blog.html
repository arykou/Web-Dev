        <p>Very important - following the given structure

In most cases, only two things are expected from a written review of a work: a story about what is written in the book (what it is about) and your personal opinion about it (you write because you liked the book and hooked it, or vice versa - this is a negative review). So, when you start writing a review, you should stick to something like this structure.</p>

        <p>Nikolai Nekrasov

I spent the night on the streets and starved

Nekrasov began to write his first poems in a notebook while studying at the Yaroslavl gymnasium, after which his father wanted to send the boy to a noble regiment. However, when he arrived in St. Petersburg to be assigned to the service, Nekrasov realized that he wanted to study, and despite his father's threats to leave him without financial support, he began to prepare for university entrance exams.

The desire to study was so strong that, having failed the entrance exam, Nekrasov still went as a free listener to the Faculty of Philology and spent 3 years there. All this time, deprived of the support of his father, he was forced to earn his own living. Often a novice writer was left without lunch and a roof over his head. He starved, spent the night on the streets and in flophouses, was often ill.

In order to somehow earn a living, the young man began to give lessons, write small articles for newspapers, compose fairy tales and vaudeville. "My God, how much I worked!", he recalled years later about his student days. Nekrasov still managed to save some money, and at the age of 19 he published his first book at his own expense - a collection of poems "Dreams and Sounds".

The young poet took this edition to Zhukovsky, who advised him to print works without a name: "Later you will write better, and you will be ashamed of these poems." Belinsky also criticized the collection in the magazine "Domestic Notes". The book was not popular, and then Nekrasov himself bought up the entire circulation in order to destroy it.

Another man would have despaired in his place. But the graduate of the Faculty of Philology decided to continue to try himself in literature. From his pen soon came realistic stories about the common people and the poor, which later made him one of the main representatives of the "natural school", as well as humorous stories. Nekrasov got a job on the staff of the "Domestic Notes" to Belinsky, who criticized him some couple of years ago. This was the beginning of his literary and publishing career. </p>
