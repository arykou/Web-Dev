    <h1> My love</h1>
    <p> Now that you’re gone, I realize<br>
How much you meant to me.<br>
My loss is wide as a starless night sky,<br>
And deep as a stormy sea. <br> <br>

I miss the comfort of your sweet love,<br>
Your absolute devotion;<br>
Now I’m a fountain of endless tears,<br>
A pool of sad emotion. <br> <br>

They tell me I should move on with life,<br>
That time will heal my pain;<br>
I smile and nod and agree with them,<br>
While I slowly go insane.<br> <br>
